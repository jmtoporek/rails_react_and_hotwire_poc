          <p class="lead mb-4">I love building web apps using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" class="link" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails (RoR)</a>. I am also a big fan of <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> when building interactive web pages. A couple of years ago I wanted to build a SaaS that had some complex use cases. While using RoR as an API, and buiding single page apps with React and React Router can make for a great user experience, it can take significantly more time. I also didn't want to lose the ability to do server side rendered erb pages. That's why I opted to use a gem called <a href="https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/" target="_blank">React on Rails (RoR)</a> , it makes it easy to use React and Rails togther without building a Single Page App. The application I've been working on is called <a href="https://keenforms.com" target="_blank">Keenforms</a>, it's a form builder with a rules engine and a no code interface.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">Keenforms however is just a side project. I make a living as a consultant primarily building web based apps. Almost all of the apps I typically work on are Single Page Applications (SPAs), relying heavily on 2 of the most popular Javascript frameworks/libraries, React and Angular. As someone who makes a living building these apps there have been moments where I've had the thought "is this really necessary for <i>every single project</i>?" While there are definitely use cases where the effort required to build these apps can be justified, because of the User Experience that only modern SPAs can deliver, its become the norm whether the the project requirements merit them or not. It keeps the lights on, but I don't think this is a good idea for every single project. <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/html-over-the-wire/" target="_blank">I know I'm not alone in this sentiment.</a></p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">Those feelings almost always occur when I'm forced to use Angular, not when I use React. But even for the simplest of use cases building a React component at times seems a bit excessive. There are at least a couple of projects that would have gone smoother if we had just done most of the rendering server side, and then leverage jQuery or plain old javascript when the UX called for it.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">Recently there has been a lot discussion about the release of Rails 7 and <a href="https://hotwired.dev/" target="_blank">Hotwire/Stimulus</a>. It's a different approach to building interactive Rails apps, where the server renders the HTML, and the javascript replaces or updates those DOM elements. I found it worth investigating because, while I feel that React does the best job of being able to deliver the kind of user experience I want, for simpler features it would seem that the Simulus & Hotwire approach could deliver something comparable, but with less effort, less code and less complexity - at least when compared to building a React component from scratch.</p>
  
          <p class="lead mb-4">I have seen some interesting demos and tutorials online, like at <a href="https://gorails.com/episodes/hotwire-rails" target="_blank">GoRails</a> or <a href="https://www.colby.so/posts/instant-search-with-rails-6-and-hotwire" target="_blank">David Colby's blog</a>. I wanted to at least try out Hotwire/Stimulus, if only to experience first hand if it was an option worth considering.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">It took some effort to get Hotwire/Stimulus working in the app. Just adding it to the client side assets was a hassle. Part of that is related to how Keenforms was already is using webpacker. Most of the tutorials were not using webpacker, since Rails 7 switched away from Websprockets to import maps as the default for packaging client side assets. I even reached out to David Colby as well as the Slack channel for React on Rails when I got stuck. However after a lot frustration I eventualy figured it out. After announcing my success on the Slack channel, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/railsonmaui/" target="_blank">Justin Gordon</a>, the brains behind React on Rails, asked if I could provide a code sample. I really should have been worked on marketing and promotion for <a href="https://keenforms.com" target="_blank">Keenforms</a>, but being a coder I'd rather write code. So here it is, both React on Rails and Stimulus/Hotwire working in the same code base.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">Is this even a good idea? To build an app that has both of these front end frameworks? That's not really something I considered when I started this, but if you're asking...</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">I really like the approach of using turbo frames/streams to generate HTML over the wire. It makes a lot of sense to let the back end generate the HTML, and perform wholesale replacement of sections of a webpage, especially for <a href="https://www.colby.so/posts/instant-search-with-rails-6-and-hotwire" target="_blank">David Colby's example where you can search dynamically without reloading the page.</a> You are sacrificing at least some control and user experience when you take this approach, but its definitely requires less code to implement compared to building the same feature in React.</p>
          
          <p class="lead mb-4">However for someone like myself, who has written a lot of Javascript over the years (since 2008!), and has learned and forgetten more Javascript frameworks and libraries that I ever wanted (ExtJs/Sencha!) and has seen so many of these libraries fall into and out of favor, I have to say that Stimulus leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
          
          <p class="lead mb-4">Perhaps its a bit too early for me to pass judgement on Stimulus just yet. However based on the small sample size of what I've learned, the most diplomatic response would be that I have yet to see anything in Stimulus that makes me want to use it. Based on the fact that its so rails specific, it seems highly unlikely that it will gain amuch traction outside the hardcore Rails crowd.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">First and foremost I'm not a fan of Stimulus' syntax. It uses a similar approach as Rails, "convention over configuration" in how you need to name the file of your stimulus controller, and how it is magically binds to the HTML page and the DOM elements. To get functions to bind to HTML elements you add data attributes to to the HTML, things like 
<pre>
<code>&lt;button data-action="click->hello#greet"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
</pre>
          </p> 
            
          <p class="lead mb-4">The format is <code>[action]->[controller_name]#[function_name]</code>. It works similiarly with setting targets. What's annoying is that when Rails uses convention over configuration, it does so by setting up defaults that can be overriden, like the name of your ActiveRecord Models and the default table names. That does not appear to be the case here with Stimulus. If you have a typo with the file name of your stimulus controller you won't get a warning that controller could not find the an HTML tag to bind to.</p>
          
          <p class="lead mb-4">On top of that, Stimulus, in some strange ways reminds me of some of things I don't like about Angular. React and Vue use a virtual DOM and let you write javascript to generate your HTML. Stimulus and Angular on the other hand both use this weird hydrid where you add tags to HTML, and then Stimulus magically scans the DOM looking fort tags, and then binds to DOM the javascript file. Its all implicit rather than explicit.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">Stimulus' documentation is lacking. There is no well defined list of actions that Stimulus recognizes, it just has a short list of the most obvious ones like "click" for a button.</p>
                    
          <p class="lead mb-4">Turbo does the work of replacing or appending DOM element on the page. I like how Turbo works, but its a black box right now. Stimulus makes the outbound call, and somehow Turbo recevies that call and updates the appropriate DOM elements.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">Once I figured out how to get Stimulus and Turbo working per the tutorial, I had the realization that I could have saved a lot of trouble by building nearly the same thing using plain old jQuery. I think the jQuery approach makes a lot more sense because you write javascript with explicit syntax and manage the interactions with javascript, as opposed to adding data tags to your HTML that Stimulus will pick up automagically. Jquery is better documented, well supported and quite frankly it's a better framework. Also it helps that I already know jQuery pretty well. Heck at one point early on my experience with jQuery I used this very approach, with specific ajax end points to get new HTML fragments that would be swapped out depending on the events on the front end. A simple onkeydown event, an ajax call, and $("#players").replaceWith(data) does everything that the Stimulus/Hotwire turbo frame tutorial does. Admittedly the dedicated end point for getting the players frame that I added to the Rails controller in <code>controllers/jquery/players#player_frame</code> isn't nearly as elegant as the hotwire approach, but that's only because I could not figure out how to make an ajax request formatted for turbo_stream.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">I had already seen enough of Stimulus to know I didn't like the direction it was going. A much less diplomatic take on Stimulus would be I have no idea why any decent front end developer would choose to use it over jQuery. I appreciate the work that the Rails core team and DHH have done over the years, but I'm taking a pass on this. After getting Stimulus working based in David Colby's tutorial I noticed it leverages Rails-ujs, specifically <code>Rails.fire</code>. I started looking for the documentation on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rails/ujs">Rails-ujs</a>, and I can't find it. As of 2021.12.30, the day I'm writing this there isn't even a readme file for it on github, and it's 3 years old. If the Rails team doesn't think you need documentation for a critical javascript file for rails (think about the confirm popup on delete) then how can I trust that they'll ever write proper docs for Stimulus?</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4">Stimulus does seem marginally better at templating and state management when compared to jQuery. I have not fully explored data streams and web sockets using Stimulus/Hotwire. However based on what I've seen and learned so far about Stimulus and Hotwire, I have a hard time justifying learning yet another javascript framework that, if I'm being totally honest, is a substandard replacement for jQuery. Trading in jQuery for Stimulus' slightly better templating and state management and bad everything else is a terrible trade off. If you really want to ditch React/Angular/Vue for something simpler, don't trade it in for Stimulus, just use jQuery.</p>
